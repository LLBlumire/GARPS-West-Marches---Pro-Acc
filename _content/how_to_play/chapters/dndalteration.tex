\chapter{Alterations to existing D\&D rules}
In order to maintain consistency between Dungeon Masters the Dungeon Masters will be following Rules as Written (RAW) where possible. In places where RAW is either unclear or ambiguous then Dungeon Masters will make rulings on the spot. It is requested that if a Dungeon Master gets a rule wrong within a session that players refrain from correcting them within a session, rather wait until the end of the session, unless in the instance where an incorrect call by a Dungeon Master would cause a major change in the session such as a player death. \newline
However there are some changes to the rules that are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Long rests can only be taken within a town or an official outpost (A list of outposts will be listed in a later section)
  \item We are using the variant encumbrance rules.
  \item We are using the the Gritty Realism variant rule for rests meaning that longrests take 7 days and short rests take 8 hours.
  \item We are allowing feats
  \item We are allowing multiclassing.
  \item We are not allowing variant humans.
  \item We are using the gritty realism variant rules (so long rests take a week and a short rest takes an hour).
  \item we are using the flanking optional rule. 
\end{itemize}
It is noted that this list may be expanded.
